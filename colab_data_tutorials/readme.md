# Python/Colab Data Tutorials
These notebooks are in-class activities that teach students geomorphic concepts as well as data science and data collection techniques 

I chose the word "tutorial" to describe these activities because I lead students through examples and then ask them to write a few blocks of code of their own at the end of the activity. 

Students can then borrow as much as they want from these data tutorials for their own [final data projects](https://github.com/jmdelvecchio/ears33/tree/main/student_projects). 

## Data tutorials for Spring 2022.

1. DT 1 - <b>Introduction to Python</b> and notebooks from [Simon Mudd's excellent teaching notebok repository](https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/smm_teaching_notebooks), with reflection questions and plotting tips added by me 
2. DT 2 - <b>Soil production function</b> from the [same repository](https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/smm_teaching_notebooks) with added reflection question of numerically solving for the time needed to reach equilibrium soil thickness 
3. DT 3\* - <b>Nested watersheds and discharge records</b> demonstrate the USGS's [dataretrieval](https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval) package for Python as well as hydrograph trends and flood frequency calculations
4. DT 4\* - <b>Diffusion rate complilation</b> by Richardson et al. (2019, Geology) allow students to practice Pandas dataframe slicing and plotting by groups, and asks students to compare some real-life field data to the compilation
5. DT 5\* - <b>Remote sensing</b> of post-Hurricane Irene landslides in the Adirondacks allows students to use multispectral data and vegetation indices to examine a landscape they mapped in a previous lab 
6. DT 6 - <b>Landlab</b> introduces students to numerical landscape evolution models via [scarp diffusion](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/695269aa53862a214c45920c18d70f225a0caf76) and [advective-diffusive](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/695269aa53862a214c45920c18d70f225a0caf76), or hillslope-versus-channel, processes
