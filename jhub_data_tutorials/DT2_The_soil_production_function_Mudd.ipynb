        "We also discussed in the lecture an alternative way in which soil may be produced: where there are very slow rates of soil production where there is bare bedrock, then soil peaks at some intermediate thickness before decreasing exponentially with increasing soil thickness. This model dates back to Gilbert (1877), and makes intuitive sense: water is needed for weathering processes as we discussed today. If there is bare bedrock, water is quickly transported through overland flow and little weathering can take place. If there is too much soil, then it's unlikely to be fully saturated down to the bedrock--soil interface.\n",

The first part of the equation is the exponential function multiplied by a coefficient, $\\alpha$. $W$ is still the weathering rate, $W_0$ is the inital rate of soil production where there is no soil, and $h$ is soil depth. There are two new parameters: $h_c$ is a critical soil depth (m), and $c$ is an empirical constant. Anhert (1977) suggests that $c$ might vary between 1.7 - 2.3, $h_c$ might vary between 0.6 - 1.5, and $\\alpha$ between 0 - 1. If $\\alpha = 1$, then the relationship is simply the exponential function."
