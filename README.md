This repo hosts a collection of Python-based lessons (known as **data tutorials**) that are appropriate for an intermediate to advanced undegraduate surface processes/geomorphology course. These were originally developed as part of the EARS33 Earth Surface Processes and Landforms course at Dartmouth College by Joanmarie Del Vecchio, and have since been used in other undergraduate college courses. 

# Getting Started
*More details to come, but you can always consult online resources for installing a repo locally if you are interested in exploring or students are able to manage their own environments on their own machines*. 
## Option 1: JupyterHub
This repo is easily deployed on an institutional JupyterHub for a classroom setting. Contact your IT department to learn about your school's specific instructions, including how to build an environment for the notebooks to run. There is an `environment.yml` file included here. 
## Option 2: Google Colab
Google allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks that have decent memory allotments, which are adequate for completing these notebooks. Colab already has many packages installed, but you may need to `pip install` some specialized packages to run the notebooks. 

# Questions or issues
Please use the "Issues" tab on this GitHub repo to ask questions, **not email**. This way everyone can see the question you have (because they probably have it too!) and any edits that need to be made to the lessons can be connected to an Issue. 

# Contribute!
We welcome any contributions from the community! If you are interested, open an Issue - we can get a "Community Lessons" folder going. 

# Testers
Thank you to the people who have tested these notebooks:
