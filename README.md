# GEOL 320 - Surface Processes - Data Tutorials

This repo hosts a collection of Python-based lessons (known as **data tutorials**) that are appropriate for an intermediate to advanced undegraduate surface processes/geomorphology course. These were originally developed as part of the [EARS33](https://github.com/jmdelvecchio/ears33) Earth Surface Processes and Landforms course at Dartmouth College by Joanmarie Del Vecchio (with significant borrowing from [Simon Mudd](https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/smm_teaching_notebooks)'s notebooks for DT1 and DT2), and have since been used in other undergraduate college courses. 

This particular repo has been modified to fit the schedule and course format of GEOL 320 - Surface Processes at Wiliam & Mary for Spring 2024. 

# Getting started for GEOL 320
1. From a computer on campus or while the VPN is active, log in to W&M’s JupyterHub https://jupyterhub.wm.edu/. Click “Start My Server”, and choose Default Notebook.

2. Under “Other” navigate to “Terminal”

3. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/jmdelvecchio/geol320-sp24.git`

4. Navigate to the newly downloaded `geol320-sp24`directory, and then into the `jhub_data_tutorials` and begin!

5. Note the `extra_tutorials` directory that contains an additional data tutorial as well as some help with geospatial data and more plotting help. 

# Not from W&M?
If you found this notebook and want to implement these activities in your own class, check out the [PyCoGSS repo](https://github.com/pycogss/course-geomorph-i) where the more general activities live! This version just fits with this particular class' schedule and grading scheme. 

# Testers
